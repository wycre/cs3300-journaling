1. As someone who keeps a journal, so that I can ensure the journal is private, I want to be able to choose how my journal posts can be seen by others.

3. As a journal author, so that I can manage my multiple journals easier, I want to be able to view a list of all my journals with easy links to edit them.
4. As a parent who is not great with technology, so that I can keep up with my younger family, I want to be able to view their posts without needing to create an account.
5. As a user with a tight schedule, so that I can keep up with journaling tasks and regular sharing and never forget to make a post or share with family, I want to be able to set reminders and automatic actions.
6. As someone who keeps journals of my travels, so that I can share my travel journals with friends and family easier, I want to be able to share my journals through many different channels.
7. As a user who is frequently not able to connect to the internet, so that I can draft my posts without waiting for internet access, I want to be able to use the app offline to write posts that will be sent out when I eventually connect.
